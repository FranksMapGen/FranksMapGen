About: Intrigued by the algorithms in randomly generated maps found
           in games like Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress, Frank decided to see
           what goes into the development such a program. This is his
           attempt.

Usage: This just contains the source code for the program. Just compile
           normally and run the Tester class. To change map size, change
           variable found in the Tester.java file.

           i.e.
           $javac *.java
           $java Tester
